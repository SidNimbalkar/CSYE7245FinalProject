## Micro Service
Here we create a micro service for our kafka pipeline to use as endpoint. We create a flask API that takes in json input and generates a sentiment score for the input, we will use the model we trained using training.py to get this job done.
We then dockerize the said API. You can find the docker image on docker hub, using this [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/sidn10/microservice)

## Pre requisite
- You will need the docker desktop client to be running

## Run Instructions

1. `docker build -t MicroService:latest .` -- this references the `Dockerfile` at `.` (current directory) to build our Docker image & tags the docker image with `MicroService:latest`

2. Run `docker images` & find the newly built Docker image

3. `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 MicroService:latest` 

If everything worked properly, you should now have a container running, which:

1. Spins up a Flask server that accepts POST requests at http://0.0.0.0:5000/predict

2. Runs a sentiment classifier on the "data" field of the request 

3. Returns a response with the model's prediction 

To test this, you can either:

Write a POST request (e.g. using Postman or curl), here is an example response:

This is how our model looks like:
